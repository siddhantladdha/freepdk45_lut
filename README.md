# freepdk45_lut

[NCSU FreePDK45](https://eda.ncsu.edu/freepdk/freepdk45/) Lookup Tables for use with [analog_daddy](https://github.com/siddhantladdha/analog_daddy) python library.
Instructions on how these were generated is shown [here](https://github.com/siddhantladdha/analog_daddy/blob/main/docs/notebooks/freepdk_45nm_LUT_generation.ipynb)

Additionally, I have confirmed that sharing this `.npy` file does not violate any Licensing since this is data is generated using simulations and does not include any model parameters.
